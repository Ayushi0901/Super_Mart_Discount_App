# Super_Mart_Discount_App
This is my personal springboot application.

# Problem Statement
Need to Calculate discount while billing at Super market based on their purchase amount and customer type.

# Input
There can be multiple types of customers(Regular, Premium etc.) and they have been given a discount based on their purchase amount. for e.x
• Premium Customer
a) 0- 5000 0%
b) 5000- 10000 10%
c) 10000 - above 20%

• Regular Customer
a) 0- 4000 10%
b) 4000 - 8000 15%
c) 8000 - 12000 20%
d) 12000 - above 25%

# What to do ?
Write down java code(Spring boot/spring project with REST endpoints) to calculate customer discount with the junits.
It should flexible enough to accommodate new type of customers, new discount slab and change in existing slab.
